# Milestone 4 Reflections - Group F

The group has worked well together developing our final milestone 4 dashboard. Individually and collectively we have been successful at making group decisions, distributing tasks, completing assigned work by agreed upon deadlines, problem solving and brainstorming, all in a collegial and professional manner within a welcoming and creative work environment.  

We are proud to present a dashboard that graphically represents the BC surgical wait-times information in an approachable way. The information is manipulated up to show case counts (both waiting and completed) and the wait times in weeks. These two areas are further divvied up into aggregating by procedure and by hospital for a total of four tabs with plots. The data can be filtered by health authority for refined exploration. A summary tab was also introduced in this milestone to give the user some instruction on how to interpret and interact with the dashboard.

There is a small bug that we have noticed with our dashboard. When loading the app on Heroku, it sometimes occurs that not all plots on a page will load. This bug is unpredictable and has proven elusive when trying to troubleshoot.

There were a couple features that we had halfway implemented prior to this milestone that we were hoping to implement in this milestone. First was a range slider that would allow the user to filter the data by year. Second was a radio button that would allow the user to select if they wanted to aggregate the plots by procedure or by hospital. This would have removed the need for the two additional plot tabs added this milestone, keeping the number of tabs with plots at two. Unfortunately we were unable to make time to implement these features.

Some helpful feedback that we received was the suggestion to not show plots aggregated by procedure and plots aggregated by hospital on the same page. We found that separating them resulted in a more easily understood layout for each page.
