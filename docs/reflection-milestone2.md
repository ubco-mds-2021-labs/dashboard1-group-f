### Milestone 2 Reflections
Our group has worked well developing our basic milestone 2 dashboard.  Individually and as a group we have been successful at making group decisions, distributing tasks, completing assigned work by agreed upon deadlines, problem solving and brainstorming in a collegial and professional manner within a welcoming and creative work environment.  We are proud to present a dashboard that graphically presents the information in an approachable way.  The ability to delineate a time span by fiscal quarters is an important feature for identifying temporal trends. Although our current dashboard has many of the basic features we need, we acknowledge that it still has many limitations that will need to be addressed prior to milestone 4. These are primarily providing user orientation information, and building the ability for the user to explore the data on a more granular level by allowing data selection by specific hospital and/or procedure. We have also identified stretch features which would involve some form of linking with other healthcare data sources.  These could include the BC Ministry of Health Covid and Annual Budget datasets or hospital resource and staffing datasets.
