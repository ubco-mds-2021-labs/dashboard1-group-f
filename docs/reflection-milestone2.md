### Milestone 2 Reflections
Group has worked well developing our basic milestone 2 dashboard.  Individually and collectively we have been successful at making group decisions, distributing tasks, completing assigned work by agreed upon deadlines, problem solving and brainstorming, all in a collegial and professional manner within a welcoming and creative work environment.  

We are proud to present a dashboard that graphically represents the surgical systems information in an approachable way. The information is currently organized across two tabs representing the case counts, both waiting and completed and the wait times in weeks. The data can be filtered by health authority for refined exploration. Although our current dashboard has these important basic features, we acknowledge that it still has many limitations that will need to be addressed prior to milestone 4. First and foremost we need to connect the hashed out year slider and quarter radio buttons to the plots. We would also like to develop tools for selecting by hospitals and/or procedures.  These improvements will allow the user to explore the data on a more granular level. We have also identified several stretch features which be beneficial for health care administrtors but would require some form of linking with other healthcare data sources.  These could include the BC Ministry of Health Covid and Annual Budget datasets or hospital resource and staffing datasets.
