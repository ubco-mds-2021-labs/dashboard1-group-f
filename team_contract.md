# Team Working Contract

Below is a teamwork contract template adapted from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/tools/index.html).
It is divided into several sections, and it is expected that each group will spend some time generating at least 5 points for each section that **everyone agrees** to. 

If you are not able to agree on these points, it is a sign that your group may become dysfunctional, and you should seek advice from me (the course instructor) ASAP to resolve and mediate the discussion.

## Team Members

## Participation

All team members agree to fully participate in all aspects of the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. Welcome all members to participate in all aspects of group work as much as they can based on their various strengths.
2. All sorts of positive contributions to group activities are highly appreciated regardless of the personâ€™s strengths, background, race.
3. Diverse life experiences and individual abilities are acknowledged and valued, thereby promoting diversity, involvement, and expertise while maximising productivity and efficiency.
4. Members of the group are encouraged to be eager and professional in their participation.
5. Personal growth and skill development are aided by acceptance of one's own areas for improvement.

## Communication

All team members agree to communicate openly and transparently during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. The group will work hard to reach a consensus based on the views of all members.
2. Active listening will be a strategy for all group conversations, and each member will take turns listening as well as speaking.
3. Remarks that are sexist or racist are not tolerated.
4. Aggressive and domineering behaviour will not be tolerated.
5. Timely, respectful, concise, honest, and sincere interpersonal communication will be the norm.

## Meetings

All team members agree to meet regularly during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete ideas that we all agree to regarding scheduling and frequency of meetings:

1. We all agree on attending meetings in a Zoom or in-person in which way that works with all members.
2. Everyone in the group will be on time. Meetings will begin five to ten minutes after the agreed-upon start time, and everyone should be present and prepared at that time.
3. Unless there are unforeseen circumstances, such as illness, we should attend all meetings.
4. All members of the group will stay in the meeting until all tasks for that meeting have been completed, or the meeting has been unanimously adjourned.
5. Breaks will be selected by consensus, and they will not be longer than twenty minutes.

## Conduct

The code of conduct we have chosen is in the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.
All team members agree to following the code of conduct, and below are five concrete escalation steps that we all agree to follow in the event that the code of conduct is violated by any member of the group (Step 1 is the first thing you will do, and Step 5 is the last thing you will do).

1. If there is a minor violation of a non-major aspect of the Code of Conduct, there will be a mild reminder from the group.
2. When there is inappropriate language or other behaviour that is judged unprofessional or unacceptable in the community, team members should issue a confidential, verbal or written warning, explaining the nature of the offence and why the behaviour was wrong. It's possible that an apology will be sought.
3. If a violation occurs through a single incident or series of activities, a warning with consequences for continued behaviour.
4. When there has been a major breach of community standards, such as repeated inappropriate behaviour. The professor will be alerted of the infraction and will be sought for advice on how to proceed.
5. In case a pattern of community standards is being violated, such as persistent inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or violence toward or disparagement of groups of people. A request may be made to the professor to remove the offender from the group.

## Conflict Management

All team members agree to the following conflict management strategies:

1. Recognizing that all confrontations involve at least two opposing viewpoints, project members will maintain confidentiality.
2. Members of the group will identify areas of dispute and work together to reach an agreement. If no agreement is obtained, move on to next step.
3. The group will determine the dispute's relevancy or importance, and if it is regarded doubtful or minor, the conflict will be postponed.
4. Before calling a vote, the group will determine the amount of time for discussion or arbitration. A vote will be called by the group. If the vote is tied, the neutral third party makes the final call.
5. When a problem arises, resolution will be attempted first by polite dialogue, then through professor mediation, and lastly through formal university channels.

## Deadlines

All team members agree to the following conventions around course deadlines:

1. A deadline for each individual task will be set by agreement between group members during meetings.
2. Group members should accomplish tasks by the agreed-upon deadline. If it appears that fulfilling a deadline would be difficult, the individual in question should request assistance from other team members as soon as possible to avoid a delay.
3. All group tasks' deadlines must be aligned with the course deadlines.

## Git Workflow

All team members agree to the Feature Branch workflow, and the following conventions (master branch protection):

1. All milestone assignments only live in one GitHub repository named **dashboard1-group-f**, and each milestone assignment has its own folder within the repository.
2. When each member starts building a new feature, they will create a new branch with a relevant name but apart from the main branch.
3. Any time a member would like to add, commit, and push their code, they should do that for the local and remote of the feature branch first.
4. After the remote feature branch has been pushed successfully, the member should send a pull request for merging their updated feature to the main branch assuming it was approved by other group members.
5. When conflicts happen during merging, the team member should attempt to check their work to solve within a reasonable time frame. If it could not be resolved, they should seek help from other members in order to avoid delays.
